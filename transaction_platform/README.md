# Conditional Transaction Platform

A blockchain-based platform that enables transactions to execute only when specific on-chain and off-chain conditions are met. Built with Clarity smart contracts and tested with Vitest.

## üìã Overview

This enables a wide range of use cases including escrow services, time-locked transactions, regulatory compliance checks, and multi-signature wallets.
